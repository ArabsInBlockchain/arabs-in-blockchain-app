# Arabs in Blockchain 

Arabs in blockchain is an open community that gathers all the Arabs in blockchain domain with different experience levels, different interests, and different fields. It's an open borderless community to empower Arabs in blockchain technology. Our main goal is to build a strong supportive community and explain blockchain for Arabs in their own language ( Arabic) to eliminate the language barrier. In Arabs in blockchain, we are building the blockchain community in the Arab world by highly engaging the community itself as everyone in this community is a stakeholder, and strengthening this community would positively reflect on all of us.
